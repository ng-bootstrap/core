<p>
  Accordion is a component that allows you to organize sections of the user interface into collapsable panels.
</p>


<ngbd-overview-section [section]="sections['basic-usage']">
  <p>
    In the most primitive form, an accordion is used by creating an <code>ngb-accordion</code> element, with nested <code>ngb-panel</code> elements within it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example might look something like:
    <ngbd-code lang="html" [code]="BASIC_NO_OPTS"></ngbd-code>
  </p>

  <p>
    The above example uses the <code>title</code> attribute for the ngb-panel element to define the text displayed on the panel
    header. While this can be customized, this setup provides the basic representation of the title as clickable text.
  </p>

  <p>
    The above example also uses the <code>ngbPanelContent</code> directive to denote the container of the content to be displayed in the panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some additional notes around basic usage of the component are the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The accordion element can be given a template reference variable, which allows external controls to drive the
      operation of the accordion (i.e., which panels are open).
    </li>
    <li>
      Each <code>ngb-panel</code> can be given an <code>id</code> attribute, which would allow for direct access to
      identify or toggle the open status of the given panel.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is also possible to assign the <code>activeIds</code> attribute of the <code>ngb-accordion</code> element to the
      value of one of the specified <code>ngb-panel</code> element's <code>id</code> to define which panel is open by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      A panel can also be disabled, which prevents it from being able to be opened by using the <code>disabled</code> attribute.
    </li>

    <li>
      The accordion itself can also be set to only allow one open panel at a time by using the <code>closeOthers</code> attribute.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Customization Info
  </p>
  <p>
    There are really 2 ways to customize the usage of the accordion.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom Panel Headers</li>
    <li>Custom Global Configuration</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Custom Panel Headers</h3>

  <p>
    <code>ngb-panel</code> supports the <code>title</code> attribute for defining a simple, click-able header with text
    for the panel which works in many cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, sometimes it is useful to be able to do something more advanced with the header, such as display custom
    HTML, or use a button or a specific click-able element to trigger the toggle behavior for the panel.
  </p>

  <p>
    To accomplish this, the following directives will be helpful:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>ngbPanelHeader</code></li>
    <li><code>ngbPanelToggle</code></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    By using these directives to associate the toggle element and the header content, custom panel headers can easily be implemented.
    The common way of doing this basically involves defining multiple <code>ng-template</code> blocks, and applying the aforementioned
    directives.  Let's take a look:
  </p>

  <h5>Using Bootstrap standard utility classes for a basic, stretched button</h5>
  <p>Visiually, this is similar to the default text based implementation since the button is stretched the width of the panel.</p>
  <ngbd-code lang="html" [code]="CUSTOM_OPT_1"></ngbd-code>

  <h5>Using Bootstrap standard utility classes for a more customized button</h5>
  <p>This approach demonstrates how an arbitrarily placed button can be used to toggle the panel functionality.</p>
  <ngbd-code lang="html" [code]="CUSTOM_OPT_2"></ngbd-code>

  <h5>Using entirely custom HTML</h5>
  <p>If you would rather use some bit of HTML to define the header, this approach will work fine.</p>
  <ngbd-code lang="html" [code]="CUSTOM_OPT_3"></ngbd-code>



  <h3>Custom Panel Headers</h3>

  <p>
    By injecting <code>NgbAccordionConfig</code>, default values can be established for all usages of an accordion.
    For example, setting <code>closeOthers</code> could be used to ensure all accordions inherit that option when they are
    used.
