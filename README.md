### NG Bootstrap - [Angular 2](http://angular.io/) directives specific to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ng-bootstrap/core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ng-bootstrap/core)

Welcome to the Angular 2 version of the []Angular UI Bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) library.
This library is being built from scratch in TypeScript using the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.

As with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, this library is a work in progress. Please check out our list of [issues](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/issues)
to see all the things we are implementing. Feel free to make comments there.


This project is being created by the [ui-bootstrap team](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap).

## Supported browsers

As Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2 are still in active development this list of supported browsers is subject to
change. It is our intention to support the same browsers and versions supported by both Bootstrap 4 and
Angular 2, which ever is the _most_ restrictive.

As of this writing, Angular 2 browser support is unknown, but Bootstrap's are:

* Chrome (stable and canary channel)
* Firefox
* IE 9+ (but see [Bootstrap 4's notes](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/browsers-devices/#internet-explorer-9) on IE9)
* Opera
* Safari

While modern mobile browsers should work without problems, we have made certain design decisions surrounding
proper UX on mobile and as such, the following may work, but are not officially supported:

* Tooltips and popovers
* TBD
